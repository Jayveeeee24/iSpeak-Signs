<h1 align="center">iSpeak Signs</h1>

**This Repository contains my undergraduate thesis project** for the degree BS Computer Science at Cavite State University - Cavite City Campus.
It is a collaborative project with our team from the **Cavite State University-Cavite City Campus Gender and Development (CvSU-CCC GAD Unit)**
and **Persons and Disabilities Affairs Office Cavite (PDAO)**.
It aims to provide a **Filipino Sign Language (FSL) learning application** for signers and non signers in the CvSU through the inclusion of gender mainstreaming strategy.
All content resources presented within the application are **verified, validated and properly demonstrated** by a licensed Sign Language Interpreter
